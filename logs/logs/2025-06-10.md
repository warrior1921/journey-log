RESEARCHED ON HOW TO CREATE A 3D SOLAR SYSTEM SIMULATION USING HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT
FINALISED MY TWO HTML PROJECTS AND CYBERSECURITY PROJECTS.
GOT TO KNOW ABOUT HOW WEBPAGE WORKS AND HOW MUCH COMPLEX IT IS TO MAKE A 3D WEBPAGE LIKE MY SOLAR SYSTEM PROJECT.
TOMMOROW I WILL START LEARNING SOME TAGS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES IN HTML SO THAT I CAN START BUILDING MY PROJECT. 
BYE , HAPPY JOURNEY.
