### 🌌 Project Log
- Created base layout for solar system
- Placed planets using images
- Planned future features:
  - Clicking planets to show info
  - Rotating orbits using CSS animations
  - 3D view using JS libraries

### 🚀 Next Focus
- Learn basic CSS to start orbit animations
- Create a pop-up card or modal to show planet info on click
- Setup a `projects/solar-system/index.html` structure in GitHub
